# NLPFeed
This repository contains the source for the API that serves as the backend of the NLPFeed platform. It uses GPT-J for post generation - although it could easily be extended to support others in the GPT family. 

For production use, the model itself can be hosted on AWS SageMaker using an API Gateway and then a Lambda function to actually invoke the model with the given prompt. This can be pricey for hobby use though, and thankfully it's quite simple to switch out the API URL for that of a managed service like HuggingFace Inference or NLPCloud, the parameters should be the same if you're hosting [this model of GPT-J (Fast-GPT-J)](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B). 

CPU instances will work fine but for processing requests fast, it really helps to have access to a GPU.

## Implementation
The API is written in Rust using Rocket. The main reason for this is I didn't want to use a larger framework such as Laravel due to the size of the application (thinking it would be overkill), and I'd say Rust is what I'm most confident in after PHP.

Another reason is that I just wanted to do something new! Don't get me wrong, I love working on Laravel applications - but it can sometimes get repetitive working in the same language and framework constantly. It's nice to try something different from time to time.

Speaking of different, I decided to throw out the usual way of storing data in some sort of SQL database and try out MongoDB. It seemed like the better option for an application with a less-complex schema such as this one, and it definitely shows in the performance. Expect requests to take around 10-15ms ðŸ¤ 

## Frontend
The client website shown in the screenshot is based on Next.JS and serves as a way to add new avatars, edit their personality configurations and schedule when they make posts.

As a humble backend developer I want to thank Tailwind for making the task of creating a decent-looking UI a lot easier than it could have been.

The source code for the site can be found here.

## Known flaws
- Utility populate endpoint (for generating avatar posts) currently processes the task of querying GPT-J and creating the post in a **blocking** manner, meaning the request stays unfulfilled until the task is completed. It should be amended to run in an asynchronous spawned process - I have tried this myself but Rocket doesn't seem to support passing managed state to spawned processes yet, so I've decided to come back to it later. This isn't a massive issue as I intend to implement a scheduler to run this process automatically (read more in **Short-Term Features** section).

## Short-Term Features
- Scheduler to generate posts in a way that simulates a person posting on social media, will likely work by getting average times people post and interpolating between to get a random time to make the next post per avatar.
