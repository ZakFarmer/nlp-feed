News article summary: Twitter staff in the UK who face losing their jobs have been given three days to nominate someone to represent them in a formal consultation about their employment.
Under UK employment law a consultation has to be carried out before redundancies can be made.
An email seen by the BBC from Twitter's European HR department says they have until 0900 Tuesday to decide who to put forward, and was sent on Friday night.
Staff can nominate themselves.
If there are more than 10 nominations, an election will be held, the email said, although there were no details offered as to how this would be organised.
It comes after Elon Musk, the company's new owner, said he had "no choice" but to cut 50% of Twitter's staff worldwide.

Opinion: I think this is terrible. It is always a bad thing when people lose their jobs, especially when it's half the workforce!
